# External dependencies

This directory contains vendored libraries and their engine integrations.
Preserve upstream copyright notices, license files, and source layout. Keep
local changes small and documented alongside the affected dependency.

## Inventory

| ImGuizmo | `ImGuizmo/`; tag `1.10`, commit `b796ac3` | Editor transform gizmo |

The table describes the vendored inputs, not a promise that every SDK module is
part of each executable. Build manifests select the files for each image.
`BFMeme/` and `gameswf/SwiffPlayer/` contain engine-specific code; they are not
covered by the claim that an upstream library is unmodified.

The individual sources and license files govern their respective components.
Keep the [Python license](python-embedded/py-src-2.3.4/LICENSE),
[Dear ImGui license](imgui/LICENSE.txt), and [ImGuizmo license](ImGuizmo/LICENSE)
with their distributions. Other dependencies carry notices in their source
files and accompanying upstream documentation.

## Build and layout contracts

### Embedded Python

The Windows build is managed by
[build_python.cmd](../../Build/python/build_python.cmd). It builds the vendored
CPython sources and zlib, names the interpreter `dice_py`, and provides a
`pycheck` consumer. Match the interpreter architecture and runtime settings to
the engine that loads it. Linux integration lives in `python-embedded/linux/`.

### TinyXML

Compile the four TinyXML implementation files without `TIXML_USE_STL`; enabling
it changes the public string types and signatures. The engine uses `TiXmlString`.
The vendored version constants and its available API do not align cleanly;
check the headers when changing a call or replacing the library.

The `dice::hfe::XMLDocument`, `XMLNode`, and `XMLAttribute` types are engine
wrappers. Keep their behavior separate from upstream TinyXML implementation.

### GameSpy

The SDK is newer than the original game's dependency. Keep the selected build
inputs and integration interfaces explicit when updating it. The
[local changes](GameSpy/LOCAL_CHANGES.md) document the maintained deltas.

### gameswf and base

Keep `gameswf/` and `base/` as siblings and put `Code/BF2/External/` on the
include path. Both libraries use `base/...` includes, including base's own
sources. `base/tu_config.h` includes the integrator-owned
`compatibility_include.h` from this directory.

[swiffplayer.cmd](../../Build/swiffplayer.cmd) builds the player separately from
the dedicated server. Its local adaptations are summarized in
[GAMESWF_DIVERGENCES.md](gameswf/GAMESWF_DIVERGENCES.md). Use the typed interfaces
of the vendored library when changing the wrapper.

### Audio codecs

[bf2audio.cmd](../../Build/bf2audio.cmd) compiles the selected Ogg/Vorbis C files
into BF2Audio. Setting `BF2AUDIO_NO_VORBIS` omits the decoder; Ogg playback then
reports the unavailable path and remains silent. The
[audio comparison harness](../../Build/bf2audio_diff.cmd) treats decoder PCM
hash differences separately from the other checks.

### Editor UI

Dear ImGui and ImGuizmo are editor-only dependencies. The editor CMake target
selects an upstream subset: ImGui core, Win32/DX9 backends, string helpers, and
ImGuizmo. They are not part of the game-image compilation sweep.

When updating a vendored library, record the exact upstream version, verify the
files against that version, preserve its notices, and review local changes
before replacing them.
